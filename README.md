# Nvidia-NIM-RAG-ChatBot

Welcome to the Nvidia-NIM-RAG-ChatBot project! This repository contains a conversational AI solution that integrates Nvidia technologies with NIM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, context-aware answers to user queries by retrieving and analyzing relevant documents. This chat system is designed to handle large document libraries and produce high-quality responses with minimal latency.
Features

    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Combines the power of information retrieval with generative AI for precise, relevant answers.
    Nvidia Integration: Optimized for GPU acceleration using Nvidia libraries, leveraging the power of CUDA, TensorRT, and other Nvidia frameworks.
    Document-Based Retrieval: Allows for importing a corpus of documents (e.g., PDF files) and uses them as the primary knowledge base.
    Customizable Architecture: Built with modularity in mind, allowing for easy modifications and expansions to adapt to new data sources or chat functionality.
